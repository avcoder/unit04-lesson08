# Use Clear Naming
Use clear, meaningful, concise names that mirrors real-world resources

- What makes an API easy or hard to understand?
- ❌ `/getTheUserInfoNow`
- ✅ `/users`
- ❌ `/processTransactionData`
- ✅ `/transactions`
- avoid implementation details
- use lowercase, hyphenated or camelCase consistently
- avoid vague terms like `/data`, `/info`, `/stuff`
