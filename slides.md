# Web Security
What's one thing you'd be terrified of if your web app got hacked?

- Definition: When the web server and all of its applications are protected and measures are put in place to protect it from harm
- Online threats are real (see Break slide)
- Users need to be able to trust that websites will keep their information safe (ex: credit card info, personal info, etc.)
- We need to be aware of the risks / pitfalls
- Consequences range from:
  - Loss of control, Loss of access, Identity theft, Data theft, Monetary theft, Spying, Embarassment

# BUT nothing can be 100% secure
M.I. [classic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifwngc8FHZM)

- new vulnerabilities arise as software changes or don't expect over time
  - software gets upgraded/added
  - configurations get changed
  - data gets updated
- Zero-Day Vulnerability: A software flaw which exposes a vulnerability but does not yet have a fix
- Overall security is only as strong as your weakest link
- Your mission: to raise the weakest points as difficult to exploit as possible, without making it a horrible experience for your users

# Principle of Least Privilege
Control access to systems and resources by granting as little access as possible

- Every program and every user should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job
- ex: if user's job is to edit text, then they should not able to browse financial data
- ex: no user should be able to edit their system access privileges
- this applies to:
  - APIs, system resources, database access, software version control, webpages

# Other General Principles

1. Simple is more secure: A house with 1 door vs. ten houses with doors and windows?
   - The larger and more complex the system, the larger attack surface, the harder it is to secure
   - üí° Use clearly named fns and vars, write comments answering 'why', prefer built-in well-tested libraries
2. Never trust users: be paranoid, every user is a potential hacker or victim of [social engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG5vsPJ5Tos)
   - devices/passwords can get stolen, user forgot to logout, disgruntled employee, contractors
   - üí° ability to quickly revoke/quarantine access
3. Expect the unexpected
   - user enters no text, too much text, paste formatted text, emojis, HTML/JS, can db query be modified
   - üí° purify/sanitize inputted text in case users submit accidental/intentional HTML/JS
4. Resilience: identify, respond, recover
   - maintain operational continuity
   - üí° monitoring systems that notify if something go wrong/suspicious, DevOps team or on call staff
5. Security through obscurity: less information given out, the better
   - üí° Hide info in login error messages, server info in response HEADER, web url file extensions

# Cookies (pg.1)

- since HTTP is stateless, cookies are used to:
   - keep track of currently authenticated user
   - store contents of a shopping cart
- stored as a header `Cookie: theme=dark`
   - Goto any website > Inspect > Applications > Cookies > click on website > identify a cookie, its value, and expiration
   - Go to console and type: `document.cookie` > what does it output?
  ```js
  document.cookie = "studentName=Albert"
  document.cookie = "session-id=abc123"
  ```
- Can you replace `studentName` with another value?


---
transition: slide-left
---

# Cookies (pg.2)

- `httpOnly` attribute - setting this to `true` prevents JS from accessing/modifying it
- `secure` attribute - ensures cookie is only sent over https connections 
   - won't send over http
   - prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
  ```js
  res.cookie('username, username, {
    httpOnly: true, // document.cookie will now be undefined
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  });
  ```
- Can you delete entire cookie on the client?  (No, but you can set expiration date to the past)
- If you don't set expiration, will default to duration of a `session` 
   ```js
   res.cookie('theme', 'dark', {
    // expires in 1 day
    expires: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000) // OR maxAge: 3600000 expires 1 hour
   });
   ```

# Heartland Data Breach 2009
Tthe company's computers were compromised, and 100 million debit/credit cards were stolen

- [Article 1](https://www.twingate.com/blog/tips/Heartland%20Payment%20Systems-data-breach), [Article 2](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/general-pci-compliance-data-security-case-study-heartland)
- SQL / NoSQL Injection: When apps pass raw user input into queries, attackers can inject operators/characters that modify the db query
  ```js
  // Insecure: directly using user input
  User.findOne({ username: req.body.username, password: req.body.password });

  // Attack Payload
  { "username": { "$ne": null }, "password": { "$ne": null }}
  ```
- Fixes:
   ```js
    // Validation + parameterization
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    if (typeof username !== 'string' || typeof password !== 'string') return res.status(400).send('Invalid input');
    User.findOne({ username, password });
   ```
- use bcrypt and token-based auth, express-validator or manual checks, sanitize via validator.js
- see example of [mySQL injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OPVViV-GQk&t=128s)

# The Samy Worm Breach [üéß](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/61/)
Tthe company's computers were compromised, and 100 million debit/credit cards were stolen

- [Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-cross-site-scripting-xss-took-down-myspace-tim-queen--0drke/)
- XSS: Cross Site Scripting can inject javascript when websites output raw HTML without escaping

1. In our foodtruck app, add a new foodtruck with title as `<script>alert('hacked')</script>`
2. In home.ejs, change the truck name output from `<%=` to `<%-`
   - But how did it get there in the first place? üí° We should purify/sanitize our inputs
3. `npm i sanitize-html` 
  ```js
  const createTruck = async (req, res) => {
    const truckData = req.body;
    truckData.name = sanitize(truckData.name, {
      allowedTags: [],
      allowedAttributes: {},
    });
  ```
4. use [DOMPurify](https://cure53.de/purify) on your frontend
  ```js
    <img src="/icons/map-pin.svg" alt=""> ${DOMPurify.sanitize(temp, { ALLOWED_TAGS: [] })}</a>
  ```

# GitHub "Delete Repo" Bug 
Users could be tricked into visiting a malicious site that auto-submitted a delete form to Github

- [Article](https://www.cve.news/cve-2023-5498/)
- CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery is when a user is tricked into performing an unwanted action on a web application where they were already authenticated
- CSRF abuses the automatic sending of cookies by browsers (ex: session tokens) with every request, even if the request comes from another site
- npm [csrf packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=csrf)

# Instagram Account Takeover via OTP Brute Force
Researcher discovered a vulnerability in Instagram's one-time-password recovery system for mobile devices

- [Article](https://www.securityweek.com/instagram-account-takeover-vulnerability-earns-hacker-30000/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Although Instagram implemented rate limiting to prevent brute-forcing of the  six-digit verification code, the researcher found that sending 1,000 requests resulted in 250 successful ones. By combining this with IP rotation, the attacker managed to send 200,000 requests, leading to a significant account takeover incident
- RATE-LIMITING:  a technique used to control how many requests a user, IP address, or application can make to a server or API in a specific time window.
   - ex: ‚ÄúOnly allow 100 requests per IP per 10 minutes.‚Äù
   - If a user exceeds this, the server blocks or delays further requests.
- npm [rate-limit package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)

# Same Origin Policy

- a security measure implemented by web browsers to restrict how documents or scripts loaded from one origin interact with resources from another origin.
- Two resources from different sites should NOT be able to interfere with each other
- `Origin = Protocol + Domain + Port`
   - if any of the above are different, then it's not the same origin
- Way around it: `CORS`

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

- occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.
- examples:
   - Insecure Wi-Fi networks (e.g., public hotspots)
   - DNS spoofing
   - HTTPS stripping (forcing a site to use HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- Solutions: 
   - use `https`
   - Avoid public or unsecured Wi-Fi
   - use VPNs

# Content Security Policy (pg.1)
Blacklist resoures that are NOT allowed to load. Whitelist resources that are allowed to load

- Allows devs to control the resources the browser is allowed to load for their site
- Create Allowlist Domains: specify which domains are permitted to load resources such as scripts, styles, or images
- Directive Based: use various directives to control what content is allowed
- Report Violations: optionally configure CSP to report violations to a specified URI
- Helps prevent a range of attacks, including XSS, and data injection attacks
- ex: I'll allow CSS from this domain and scripts from another
- ex: if someone installs their 3rd party script, CSP won't run it.
  ```html
  // example header
  Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' htps://trustme.com 

  // OR example meta
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' https://trustme.com">
  ```

# Setting CSP in express.js via helmet

app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net'],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'],
        fontSrc: ["'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com'],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:'],
        connectSrc: ["'self'"],
        objectSrc: ["'none'"],
        upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
      },
    },
  })

# Authentication vs Authorization
What's the difference?

- Authentication: Verifying who a user is
   - Tools: Passport.js, OAuth
   - Should: use strong passwords, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), session expiration
- Authorization: Determining what the user can do (ex: admin vs editor vs regular user)
   - Tools: use middleware to role check, [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) or morgan for logging
   - Should: consistently examine who can access what? keep a record (audit trail) of system events and actions, Log logins, data changes, access denials, etc.

# Coinbase Authorization Bug (pg.1)
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

- [Article 1](https://salt.security/blog/understanding-the-coinbase-api-vulnerability) [Article 2](https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/blog/retrospective-recent-coinbase-bug-bounty-award)
- BOLA: Broken Object Level Authorization refers to flaws in governing access rules
- Most common API vulnerability
- Ask: Can user A perform an action on an unauthorized object? (ex: User B's data)
- Below is what a normal transaction looks like.  Hacker replaced product_id with BitCoin to see potential revealing error message.  But instead his $1060 of Etherum sold for $43000 Bitcoin!

# Coinbase Authorization Bug (pg.2)

- Lesson:
   - Your UI is not part of your security
   - even though the UI prevented this kind of API hack, don't depend on UI
   - if hacker can get at API level, UI is useless
- Should:
   - Discuss authorization rules during API design phase
   - Review business requirements and define data access policies
   - Enforce authorization controls at API layer
   - Implement automated, pre-production testing to find any BOLA flaws

# DuoLingo's Broken Authentication
Hacker exposes over 2 million DuoLingo's user emails and names 

- [Article 1](https://hackread.com/api-misuse-hacker-leak-duolingo-emails-names/) [Article 2](https://www.cequence.ai/blog/api-security/api-breach-duolingo/)
- Broken Authentication: API vulnerability due to weak authentication such as missing security controls, or poorly implemented controls
- Risks: data harvesting, abuse of your API
- ex: no 2FA, no captcha, credential stuffing, not using [OAuth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/security/business/security-101/what-is-oauth)
- in DuoLingo's case, the breach was facilitated by an exposed API endpoint that allowed anyone to submit an email address and retrieve associated user data, including names, email addresses, and languages studied.
- test it out with your email `https://www.duolingo.com/2017-06-30/users?email=`
- try `email=joesmith@gmail.com` -- does it reveal any info?
- Should: 
   - define auth policies based on business requirements (ex: checking weather ‚úÖ.  transferring funds üîí)
   - implement automated testing to identify gaps
